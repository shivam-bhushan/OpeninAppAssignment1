# OpeninAppAssignment1
Wav2Lip Deep Fake (Assignment1 for OpeninApp)

## Prerequisite

- Please make sure you have enabled GPU runtime in Google Collab

- Drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1L-v2coK1WISU6l5uTqDahA6Fe-H9YNK7?usp=sharing

- I have taken the liberty to edit out the parts where the face of the YouTuber was not visible as that gave me a better result. The unedited version of the original video and the lipsync are also available in the respective folders

- The video and the audio files have been edited down to fit 60 seconds as that's a prerequisite for Wav2Lip

## How to run
- Open the collab link
- Run all the code blocks
- Save a copy of the folder in the drive link onto your Google Drive
- Google Collab will ask for drive access on the second block
- Once drive permission is given you can open the "Wav2lip" folder you copied to your drive
- Now choose the video input version that suits you (Inputs are stored in cleanly labeled folders). I recommend you use the edited input version for better result
- In the next block you must choose the audio file. You can find that in the "Edited Audio Files" folder
- Check "choose_hd_model" in the Model Selection field
- Run the last block. 
- Voila! You have your deep fake video output

## Output

I have also added the output folder in the Google Drive folder linked above

Cheers!
